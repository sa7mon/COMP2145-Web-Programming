#Project: PHP Array-Session

##Description
Knowing how to store data in an array and use it to build a good UI (User Interface) is a critical skill for today's web programmers. 

This project will demonstrate the following
+ I can set up and use a two-dimensional array.
+ I can display data from a 2D array using an HTML table.
+ I can build a listbox from an array.
+ My programs can figure out if a user is new or is returning for more information.
+ I can use sessions to "remember" information. This is necessary in order to build a working shopping cart.
+ I love using CSS to make my pages inviting and interesting for the user. 

The project is designed so you can demonstrate what you know and understand about arrays and sessions variables.

##Specifications
###The customer should be able to do the following
+ See the current contents of their shopping cart.
+ Add new items by selecting choices from a drop-down list box built from data stored in an array.
+ Delete items from the caret using a drop-down list box built from data stored in an array.
###The code should include the following
+ At least one single-dimensional array (used to populate the list boxes)
+ At least one two-dimensional array (used to hold the ordered items)
+ Code should all be contained in a single file using the $_SESSIONS[ ] array.
+ Debug statements showing how to display variables and arrays. (These can be commented out.)
+ HTML code using <fieldset>, <legend> and the id=" " attribute for accessibility.
+ CSS used to improve the UX (User eXperience).
+ An easy-to-find comment block near the top of the page that describes a problem you encountered and how you went about solving it.
